## Dev Requisites
`node` and `npm` are required. If you don't have these installed, the recommened approach is to use `nvm`.

`git` is also a requsite.


## Setup
Install `truffle` and `ganache-cli`.

Run: `ganache-cli`
Open a new terminal.

Clone this repo. Change into the project directory. Then run:
```
npm install
truffle compile
truffle migrate
npm run start
```

#### TODOs:
Lots of things. UI needs work. It is not recommended to follow most of the practices in the smart contract code. Corners were cut in order to produce some code in a 3 hour window (a large portion of time was spent on setting up development environments for the team).
